# react-hook-form integrations

Examples of how to implement [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
with different design systems (e.g.: [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/))
and resolvers (e.g.: [zod](https://zod.dev/)).

## Contributing

View code and contribute via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bashaus/react-hook-form-integrations).

## Packages

- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started)
- [@hookform/resolvers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/resolvers) - allows you to use any external validation library such as Zod, Yup, Joi, etc.
- [@hookform/error-message](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/error-message) - a simple component to render associated input's error message.

### Design systems

- [@mui/material](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)
- [react-dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/)

### Resolvers

This storybook example uniquely uses [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for resolving
forms. As most of the resolvers are interchangeable and because Zod is
TypeScript native, it is the preferred resolver in this repository.
