# Examples of react-hook-form

Examples of how to implement [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
with different design systems (e.g.: [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/))
and resolvers (e.g.: [zod](https://zod.dev/)).

## Packages

- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started)
- [@hookform/resolvers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/resolvers) - allows you to use any external validation library such as Zod, Yup, Joi, etc.
- [@hookform/error-message](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/error-message) - a simple component to render associated input's error message.

### Design systems

- [@mui/material](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)
- [react-dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/)

### Resolvers

This storybook example uniquely uses [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for resolving
forms. As most of the resolvers are interchangeable and because Zod is
TypeScript native, it is the preferred resolver in this repository.

## Best practices

Some guidelines to help implement react-hook-form with various third parties.

### Set defaultValues in useForm

Including default values in your `useForm` declaration can help resolve missing or undefined properties.

```typescript
const form = useForm<FormSchema>({
  /* ðŸ‘‡ Suggested default values */
  defaultValues: {
    stringField: '',
    enumField: null,
    arrayField: [],
  }
  resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
});
```
