# `react-hook-form` Integrations

Explore practical examples of using [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
with various design systems (e.g.: [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/))
and schema resolvers such as [zod](https://zod.dev/).

## How to Use

In the sidebar, you'll find stories rendering components from different design
systems and interfaces (e.g.: Material UI), showcasing how to integrate
react-hook-form and zod with each component. Just pick a component to get started.

### Viewing Code

Since some implementations can be complex and require some customization, click
the "View on GitHub" link on each story to check out the implementation details.

### Story Debugging

Each component story includes some helpful panels:

- **Form values**: Displays a serialized version of the current form data.
- **Form errors**: Shows any validation errors captured via Zod.
- **Form state**: Shows the state of the react hook form.

These panels make it easier to understand and debug how the form behaves.
